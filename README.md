# Deep-Matrix-Factorization-Recommendation-Systems
In recent years, there have been significant improvements in recommendation sys-tems, thanks to the development of deep learning algorithms that produce impressive results. The incorporation of deep learning algorithms into recommendation systems has addressed the challenges previously encountered by traditional autoencoder models. The suggested model incorporates the idea of variational concept into the deep matrix factorization (DeepMF) technique. Combining the variational compo-nent of variational autoencoders (VAE) with DeepMF leads to better results than conventional models. This unique method merges the encoding technique of VAE with the regression layers of DeepMF, which were previously trained independently or incompletely. The objective is to create a comprehensive model that improves overall effectiveness. Experiments are conducted using two publicly available datasets: MovieLens and Film Trust. Our model's performance will be assessed compared to other known models on these datasets.
